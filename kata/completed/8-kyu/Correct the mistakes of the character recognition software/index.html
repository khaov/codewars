          <p>Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.</p>

          <p>When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.</p>
          
          <p>Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><code>S</code> is misinterpreted as <code>5</code></li>
            <li><code>O</code> is misinterpreted as <code>0</code></li>
            <li><code>I</code> is misinterpreted as <code>1</code></li>
          </ul>

          <p>The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.</p>
