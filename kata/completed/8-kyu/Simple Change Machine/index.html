          <p>Your task is to create a change machine.</p>

          <p>The machine accepts a range of specified coins and notes, it returns change in 20p and 10p coins in the minimum amount of pieces. A 50p for example would return two 20p pieces and one 10p piece. The machine will always try and return change, if you input a 20p for example it will return "10p 10p".</p>

          <p>The machine accepts these coins and notes: £5, £2, £1, 50p, 20p. Any coins and notes which are not accepted by the machine will be returned. If you were to put a £20 note into the machine for example, it would be returned to you and not broken into change.</p>

          <p>This change machine is programmed to accept and distribute strings rather than numbers. The change will be returned as one string with the change separated by single spaces & no commas. The values of the string will be descending.</p>
