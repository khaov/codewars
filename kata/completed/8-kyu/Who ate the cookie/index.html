        </h1>
        <section class="instructions">
          <p>For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. If the input is a string then "Zach" ate the cookie. If the input is a float or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. If the input is anything else "the dog" ate the cookie. The way to return the statement is: "Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!"</p>

          <p>Ex: Input = "hi" --> Output = "Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach! (The reason you return Zach is because the input is a string)</p>

          <p>Note: Make sure you return the correct message with correct spaces and punctuation.</p>

          <p>Please leave feedback for this kata. Cheers!</p>
