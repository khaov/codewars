          <p>An AI has infected a text with a character!!</p>

          <p>This text is now <b>fully mutated</b> to this character.</p>

          <p>Starting with the original text, and given a character, return the text once it has been mutated so that all of the characters in the original text have been replaced with the character.</p>

          <p>
            If the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.<br>
            There will never be a case when both are empty as nothing is going on!!
          </p>

          <p>Note: The character is a string of length 1 or an empty string.</p>

          <h2>Example</h2>

<pre>
  <code>
    text before = "abc"
    character   = "z"
    text after  = "zzz"
  </code>
</pre>
