          <p>Wolves have been reintroduced to Great Britain. You are a sheep farmer, and are now plagued by wolves which pretend to be sheep. Fortunately, you are good at spotting them.</p>

          <p>Warn the sheep in front of the wolf that it is about to be eaten. Remember that you are standing <b>at the front of the queue</b> which is at the end of the array:</p>
          
<pre>
  <code>
    [sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, wolf, sheep, sheep]      (YOU ARE HERE AT THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE)
        7      6      5      4      3            2      1
  </code>
</pre>
          <p>
            If the wolf is the closest animal to you, return <code>"Pls go away and stop eating my sheep"</code>. Otherwise, return<br>
            <code>"Oi! Sheep number N! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!"</code> where <code>N</code> is the sheep's position in the queue.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> there will always be exactly one wolf in the array.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Examples</h2>
