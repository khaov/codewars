        <section class="instructions">
          <p>At the annual family gathering, the family likes to find the oldest living family member’s age and the youngest family member’s age and calculate the difference between them.</p>

          <p>You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed ‘age’ of 0. Return a new array (a tuple in Python) with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].</p>
