        </h1>
        <section class="instructions">
          <p>When it's spring Japanese cherries blossom, it's called "sakura" and it's admired a lot. The petals start to fall in late April.</p>

          <p>Suppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second (5 cm/s), and it takes 80 seconds for the petal to reach the ground from a certain branch.</p>
          
          <p>Write a function that receives the speed (in cm/s) of a petal as input, and returns the time it takes for that petal to reach the ground <b>from the same branch</b>.</p>
          
          <p>Notes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The movement of the petal is quite complicated, so in this case we can see the velocity as a constant during its falling.</li>
            <li>Pay attention to the data types.</li>
            <li>If the initial velocity is non-positive, the return value should be <code>0</code></li>
          </ul>
