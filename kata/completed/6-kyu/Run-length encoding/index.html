          <h2>Task</h2>

          <p>Your task is to write such a run-length encoding. For a given string, return a list (or array) of pairs (or arrays) [ (i1, s1), (i2, s2), …, (in, sn) ], such that one can reconstruct the original string by replicating the character sx ix times and concatening all those strings. Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values si and si+1 should differ.</p>

          <h2>Examples</h2>

          <p>As the article states, RLE is a very simple form of data compression. It's only suitable for runs of data, as one can see in the following example:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    runLengthEncoding("hello world!")
    <span class="note">//=> [[1,'h'], [1,'e'], [2,'l'], [1,'o'], [1,' '], [1,'w'], [1,'o'], [1,'r'], [1,'l'], [1,'d'], [1,'!']]</span>
  </code>
</pre>

          <p>It's very effective if the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    runLengthEncoding("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbb")
    <span class="note">// => [[34,'a'], [3,'b']]</span>
  </code>
</pre>
