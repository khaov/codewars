          <p>The distance formula can be used to find the distance between two points. What if we were trying to walk from point <b>A</b> to point <b>B</b>, but there were buildings in the way? We would need some other formula..but which?</p>

          <h2>Manhattan Distance</h2>

          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance" target="_blank">Manhattan distance</a> is the distance between two points in a grid (like the grid-like street geography of the New York borough of Manhattan) calculated by only taking a vertical and/or horizontal path.</p>
          <p>Complete the function that accepts two points and returns the Manhattan Distance between the two points.</p>
          <p>The points are arrays or tuples containing the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinate in the grid. You can think of <code>x</code> as the row in the grid, and <code>y</code> as the column.</p>

          <h2>Examples</h2>

<pre>
  <code>
    * Input [1, 1], [1, 1] => Output 0
    * Input [5, 4], [3, 2] => Output 4
    * Input [1, 1], [0, 3] => Output 3
  </code>
