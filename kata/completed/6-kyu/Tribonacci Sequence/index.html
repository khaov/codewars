          <p>Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.</p>
          <p>As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(</p>
          <p>So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with <code>[1, 1, 1]</code> as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    [1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
  </code>
</pre>

          <p>But what if we started with <code>[0, 0, 1]</code> as a signature? As starting with <code>[0, 1]</code> instead of <code>[1, 1]</code> basically <i>shifts</i> the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]    
  </code>
</pre>

          <p>Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a <b>signature</b> array/list, returns <b>the first n elements - signature included</b> of the so seeded sequence.</p>
          <p>Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if <code>n == 0</code>, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)</p>
