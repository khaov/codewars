          <h2>Task</h2>

          <p>
            You will be given a list of objects. Each object has <code>type</code>, <code>material</code>, and possibly <code>secondMaterial</code>. The existing materials are: <code>paper</code>, <code>glass</code>, <code>organic</code>, and <code>plastic</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your job is to sort these objects across the 4 recycling bins according to their <code>material</code> (and <code>secondMaterial</code> if it's present), by listing the <code>type</code>'s of objects that should go into those bins.
          </p>

          <h2>Notes</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>The bins should come in the same order as the materials listed above</li>
            <li>All bins should be listed in the output, even if some of them are empty</li>
            <li>If an object is made of two materials, its <code>type</code> should be listed in both of the respective bins</li>
            <li>The order of the <code>type</code>'s in each bin should be the same as the order of their respective objects was in the input list</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Example</h2>

<pre>
  <code>
    input = [
      {"type": "rotten apples", "material": "organic"},
      {"type": "out of date yogurt", "material": "organic", "secondMaterial": "plastic"},
      {"type": "wine bottle", "material": "glass", "secondMaterial": "paper"},
      {"type": "amazon box", "material": "paper"},
      {"type": "beer bottle", "material": "glass", "secondMaterial": "paper"}
    ]

    output = [
      ["wine bottle", "amazon box", "beer bottle"],
      ["wine bottle", "beer bottle"],
      ["rotten apples", "out of date yogurt"],
      ["out of date yogurt"]
    ]
  </code>
