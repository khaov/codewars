          <h2>Feynman's squares</h2>

          <p>Richard Phillips Feynman was a well-known American physicist and a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics. He worked in theoretical physics and pioneered the field of quantum computing.</p>
          <p>Recently, an old farmer found some papers and notes that are believed to have belonged to Feynman. Among notes about mesons and electromagnetism, there was a napkin where he wrote a simple puzzle: "how many different squares are there in a grid of NxN squares?".</p>
          <p>For example, when N=2, the answer is 5: the 2x2 square itself, plus the four 1x1 squares in its corners:</p>

          <h2>Task</h2>

          <p>Complete the function that solves Feynman's question in general. The input to your function will always be a positive integer.</p>

          <h2>Examples</h2>

<pre>
  <code>
    1  -->   1
    2  -->   5
    3  -->  14
  </code>
