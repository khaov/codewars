        <section class="instructions">
          A twin prime is a prime number that differs from another prime number by <code>2</code>. Write a function named <code>is_twin_prime</code> which takes an <code>int</code> parameter and returns <code>true</code> if it is a twin prime, else <code>false</code>.

          <h2>Examples</h2>

<pre>
  <code>
    given 5, which is prime
    5 + 2 = 7, which is prime
    5 - 2 = 3, which is prime
    hence, 5 has two prime twins and it is a Twin Prime.
  </code>
</pre>

<pre>
  <code>
    given 7, which is prime
    7 - 2 = 5, which is prime
    7 + 2 = 9. which is not prime
    hence, 7 has one prime twin, and it is a Twin Prime.
  </code>
</pre>

<pre>
  <code>
    given 9, which is not prime
    hence, 9 is not a Twin Prime
  </code>
</pre>

<pre>
  <code>
    given 953, which is prime
    953 - 2 = 951, which is not prime
    953 + 2 = 955, which is not prime
    hence, 953 is not a Twin Prime
  </code>
