          <p>You certainly can tell which is the larger number between 2<sup>10</sup> and 2<sup>15</sup>.</p>

          <p>But what about, say, 2<sup>10</sup> and 3<sup>10</sup>? You know this one too.</p>
          
          <p>Things tend to get a bit more complicated with both different bases and exponents: which is larger between 3<sup>9</sup> and 5<sup>6</sup>?</p>
          
          <p>Well, by now you have surely guessed that you have to build a function to compare powers, returning -1 if the first member is larger, 0 if they are equal, 1 otherwise; powers to compare will be provided in the <code>[base, exponent]</code> format:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    comparePowers([2,10],[2,15])===1
    comparePowers([2,10],[3,10])===1
    comparePowers([2,10],[2,10])===0
    comparePowers([3,9],[5,6])===-1
    comparePowers([7,7],[5,8])===-1
  </code>
</pre>

          <p>Only positive integers will be tested, incluing bigger numbers - you are warned now, so be diligent try to implement an efficient solution not to drain too much on CW resources ;)!</p>
