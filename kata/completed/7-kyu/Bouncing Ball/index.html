          <p>You drop a ball from a given height. After each bounce, the ball returns to some fixed proportion of its previous height. If the ball bounces to height 1 or less, we consider it to have stopped bouncing. Return the number of bounces it takes for the ball to stop moving.</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    bouncingBall(initialHeight, bouncingProportion)
          
    boucingBall(4, 0.5)
    After first bounce, ball bounces to height 2
    After second bounce, ball bounces to height 1
    Therefore answer is 2 bounces
    
    boucingBall(30, 0.3)
    After first bounce, ball bounces to height 9
    After second bounce, ball bounces to height 2.7
    After third bounce, ball bounces to height 0.81
    Therefore answer is 3 bounces
  </code>
</pre>

          <p>Initial height is an integer in range [2,1000]</p>

          <p>Bouncing Proportion is a decimal in range [0, 1)</p>
