        <section class="instructions">
          <p>You are the greatest chef on earth. No one boils eggs like you! Your restaurant is always full of guests, who love your boiled eggs. But when there is a greater order of boiled eggs, you need some time, because you have only one pot for your job. How much time do you need?</p>

          <h2>Your Task</h2>

          <p>Implement a function, which takes a non-negative integer, representing the number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (integer), which it takes to have all the eggs boiled.</p>
          
          <h2>Rules</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>you can put at most 8 eggs into the pot at once</li>
            <li>it takes 5 minutes to boil an egg</li>
            <li>we assume, that the water is boiling all the time (no time to heat up)</li>
            <li>for simplicity we also don't consider the time it takes to put eggs into the pot or get them out of it</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Example (Input --> Output)</h2>
