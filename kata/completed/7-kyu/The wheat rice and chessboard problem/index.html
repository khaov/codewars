        </h1>
        <section class="instructions">
          <p>I assume most of you are familiar with the ancient legend of the rice (but I see wikipedia suggests <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_and_chessboard_problem" target="_blank">wheat</a>, for some reason) problem, but a quick recap for you: a young man asks as a compensation only <code>1</code> grain of rice for the first square, <code>2</code> grains for the second, <code>4</code> for the third, <code>8</code> for the fourth and so on, always doubling the previous.</p>

          </p>Your task is pretty straightforward (but not necessarily easy): given an amount of grains, you need to return up to which square of the chessboard one should count in order to get at least as many.</p>

          <p>As usual, a few examples might be way better than thousands of words from me:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    0 grains need 0 cells
    1 grain needs 1 cell
    2 grains need 2 cells
    3 grains need 2 cells
    4 grains need 3 cells
    and etc.
  </code>
</pre>

          <p>Input is always going to be valid/reasonable: ie: a non negative number; extra cookie for not using a loop to compute square-by-square (at least not directly) and instead trying a smarter approach [hint: some peculiar operator]; a trick converting the number might also work: impress me!</p>
