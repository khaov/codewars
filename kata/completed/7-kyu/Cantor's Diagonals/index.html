          <p>Given a list of lists containing only 1s and 0s, return a new list that differs from list 1 in its first element, list 2 in its second element, list 3 in its 3rd element, and so on.</p>
<pre>
  <code>
  cantor([[0,0,0],
          [1,1,1],
          [0,1,0]]) = [1,0,1]

  cantor([[1,0,0],
          [0,1,0],
          [0,0,1]]) = [0,0,0]
  </code>
</pre>
          </p>The nested list will always be perfectly square. Your solution should be a list containing only 1s and 0s.</p>

          <p>See Wikipedia for background (if you're interested; it won't help you solve the kata). Obviously this kata is not the same because the lists are not infinite so it doesn't really prove anything -- consider it a tribute...</p>
