          <p>In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!</p>

          <h2>Examples:</h2>

<pre>
  <code>
    1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8
    4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> Result 12
  </code>
</pre>

          <p>
            The result may contain fives. ;-)<br>
            The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both numbers can be also negative!
          </p>

          <p>I'm very curious for your solutions and the way you solve it. Maybe someone of you will find an easy pure mathematics solution.</p>

          <p>Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)</p>

          <p>I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!</p>
