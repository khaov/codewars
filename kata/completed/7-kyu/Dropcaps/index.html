          <p>DropCaps means that the first letter of the starting word of the paragraph should be in caps and the remaining lowercase, just like you see in the newspaper.</p>

          <p>But for a change, let"s do that for each and every word of the given String. Your task is to capitalize every word that has length greater than 2, leaving smaller words as they are.</p>

          <p>*should work also on Leading and Trailing Spaces and caps.</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    "apple"            => "Apple"
    "apple of banana"  => "Apple of Banana"
    "one   space"      => "One   Space"
    "   space WALK   " => "   Space Walk   "
  </code>
</pre>

          <p>Note: you will be provided atleast one word and should take string as input and return string as output.</p>
