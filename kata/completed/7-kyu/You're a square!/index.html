          <h2>A square of squares</h2>

          <p>You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!</p>

          <p>However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.</p>

          <h2>Task</h2>

          <p>Given an integral number, determine if it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number" target="_blank">square number</a>:</p>

          <blockquote>
            In mathematics, a <b>square number</b> or <b>perfect square</b> is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
          </blockquote>

          <p>The tests will <i>always</i> use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.</p>

          <h2>Examples</h2>
<pre>
  <code>
    -1  =>  false
     0  =>  true
     3  =>  false
     4  =>  true
    25  =>  true
    26  =>  false
  </code>
