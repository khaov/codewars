        <section class="instructions">
          <p>If you like Taco Bell, you will be familiar with their signature doritos locos taco. They're very good.</p>

          <p>Why can't everything be a taco? We're going to attempt that here, turning every word we find into the taco bell recipe with each ingredient.</p>

          <p>We want to input a word as a string, and return a list representing that word as a taco.</p>

          <h2><i>Key</i></h2>

          <p>all vowels (except 'y') = beef</p>

          <p>t = tomato</p>

          <p>l = lettuce</p>

          <p>c = cheese</p>

          <p>g = guacamole</p>

          <p>s = salsa</p>

          <h2><i>NOTE</i></h2>

          <p>We do not care about case here. 'S' is therefore equivalent to 's' in our taco.</p>

          <p>Ignore all other letters; we don't want our taco uneccesarily clustered or else it will be too difficult to eat.</p>

          <p>Note that no matter what ingredients are passed, our taco will always have a shell.</p>
