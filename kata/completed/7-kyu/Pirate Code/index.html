          <p>Take a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc6VA7Q1vXQ&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">pirate game</a>.</p>

          <p>Give Amaro an array to confirm his logic for the next time, when the number of pirates changes.</p>

          <p>Keep in mind that each time the pirates find a treasure, the amount of gold equals to the <code>number of pirates * 20</code>.</p>

          <h2>Example:</h2>

          <p>If number of pirates is 2, including Amaro, then array = <code>[40, 0]</code>, So he can keep all of the gold to himself.</p>

          <p>If number of pirates is 3, including Amaro, then array = <code>[59, 0, 1]</code>, and 59 gold is his for the taking.</p>

          <p>If number of pirates is 4, including Amaro, then array = <code>[79, 0, 1, 0]</code>, and 79 gold is his to take.</p>

          <p>If number of pirates is 5, including Amaro, then array = <code>[98, 0, 1, 0, 1]</code>, and 98 gold is his for the taking.</p>
