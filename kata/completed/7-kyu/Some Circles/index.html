          <p>Write a function that takes as its parameters <i>one or more numbers which are the diameters of circles</i>.</p>
          <p>The function should return the <i>total area of all the circles</i>, rounded to the nearest integer in a string that says "We have this much circle: xyz".</p>
          <p>You don't know how many circles you will be given, but you can assume it will be at least one.</p>
          <p>So:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    sumCircles(2) == "We have this much circle: 3"
    sumCircles(2, 3, 4) == "We have this much circle: 23"
  </code>
</pre>
