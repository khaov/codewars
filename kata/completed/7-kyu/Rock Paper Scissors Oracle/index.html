          <p>You are the rock paper scissors oracle.</p>
          <p>Famed throughout the land, you have the incredible ability to predict which hand gestures your opponent will choose out of rock, paper and scissors.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately you're no longer a youngster, and have trouble moving your hands between rounds. For this reason, you can only pick a single gesture for each opponent. If it's possible for you to win, you will, but you're also happy to tie.</p>
          <p>Given an array of gestures — for example <code>["paper", "scissors", "scissors"]</code> — return the winning gesture/s in the order in which they appear in the title, separated by a forward slash. For example, if rock and scissors could both be used to win you would return:</p>
          <p><code>"rock/scissors"</code></p>
          <p>If it's not possible for you to win then return:</p>
          <p><code>"tie"</code></p>
