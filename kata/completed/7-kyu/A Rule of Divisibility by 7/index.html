            <span>(7 kyu)</span> A Rule of Divisibility by 7
        </h1>
        <section class="instructions">
          <p>number m of the form 10x + y is divisible by 7 if and only if x − 2y is divisible by 7. In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. Continue to do this until a number known to be divisible by 7 is obtained; you can stop when this number has at most 2 digits because you are supposed to know if a number of at most 2 digits is divisible by 7 or not.</p>

          <p>The original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the last number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7.</p>

          <h2>Examples:</h2>
          <p>1 - <code>m = 371 -> 37 − (2×1) -> 37 − 2 = 35</code>; thus, since 35 is divisible by 7, 371 is divisible by 7.</p>

          <p>The number of steps to get the result is <code>1</code>.</p>

          <p>2 - <code>m = 1603 -> 160 - (2 x 3) -> 154 -> 15 - 8 = 7</code> and 7 is divisible by 7.</p>

          <p>3 - <code>m = 372 -> 37 − (2×2) -> 37 − 4 = 33</code>; thus, since 33 is not divisible by 7, 372 is not divisible by 7.</p>

          <p>4 - <code>m = 477557101->47755708->4775554->477547->47740->4774->469->28</code> and 28 is divisible by 7, so is 477557101. The number of steps is 7.</p>

          <h2>Task:</h2>
          <p>Your task is to return to the function <code>seven(m)</code> (m integer >= 0) an array (or a pair, depending on the language) of numbers, the first being the last number <code>m</code> with at most 2 digits obtained by your function (this last <code>m</code> will be divisible or not by 7), the second one being the number of steps to get the result.</p>

          <h2>Forth Note:</h2>
          <p>Return on the <code>stack number-of-steps, last-number-m-with-at-most-2-digits</code></p>

          <h2>Examples:</h2>

<pre>
  <code>
    seven(371) should return [35, 1]
    seven(1603) should return [7, 2]
    seven(477557101) should return [28, 7]
  </code>
