          <p>In Pokemon Go, an easy way to increase your XP level is to evolve pokemon you've caught.</p>

          <p>Every time you catch a pokemon, you also receive some Candy. The Candy is limited to the pokemon type (eg. a Pidgey will give you Pidgey Candy) and once you have enough, you can spend it to evolve a pokemon.</p>

          <p>To evolve a Pidgey costs 12 Pidgey Candy, but you'll be rewarded with 500 XP and 1 extra Pidgey Candy.</p>

          <p>Surplus Pidgeys can be transferred to Professor Willow in exchange for 1 Pidgey Candy - you won't get the Pidgey back.</p>

          <p>#Example</p>

          <p>If you have 2 Pidgeys and 23 Pidgey Candy, you can evolve 1 Pidgey for 12 Pidgey Candy. You have 11 Pidgey Candy left, but you received 1 Pidgey Candy for evolving the first Pidgey, making the 12 you need to evolve the 2nd. You will end up with 1000 XP.</p>

          <p>#Your job</p>

          <p>Create a function that will take 2 integers as arguments: a number of Pidgeys and an amount of Pidgey Candy. It should return the maximum XP gained from evolving the highest possible number of Pidgeys.</p>

          <p>Remember, you'll need to take into account the extra Pidgey Candy gained from tranferring and evolving Pidgeys.</p>
