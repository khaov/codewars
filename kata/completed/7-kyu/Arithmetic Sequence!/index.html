            A sequence is usually a set or an array of numbers that has a strict way for moving from the nth term to the (n+1)th term.
            If <code>f(n) = f(n-1) + c</code> where <code>c</code> is a constant value, then <code>f</code> is an arithmetic sequence.<br>
            An example would be (where the first term is 0 and the constant is 1) is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... and so on] )<br>
            Else if (pun) <code>f(n) = f(n-1) * c</code> where <code>c</code> is a constant value, then <code>f</code> is a geometric sequence.<br>
            Example where the first term is 2 and the constant is 2 will be [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ... to infinity ... ]<br>
            There are some sequences that aren't arithmetic nor are they geometric.<br>
            Here is a link to feed your brain : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence" target="_blank">Sequence</a> !
          </p>

          <p>You're going to write a function that's going to return the value in the nth index of an arithmetic sequence.(That is, adding a constant to move to the next element in the "set").</p>

          <p>The function's name is <code>nthterm</code>/<code>Nthterm</code>, it takes three inputs <code>first</code>,<code>n</code>,<code>c</code> where:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><code>first</code> is the first value in the 0 INDEX.</li>
            <li><code>n</code> is the index of the value we want.</li>
            <li><code>c</code> is the constant added between the terms.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Remember that <code>first</code> is in the index <code>0</code> .. just saying ...</p>
