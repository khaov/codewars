        </h1>
        <section class="instructions">
          <p>Create a function that takes two arguments:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>An array of objects which feature the season, the team and the country of the Champions League winner.</li>
            <li>Country (as a string, for example, 'Portugal')</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You function should then return the number which represents the number of times a team from a given country has won. Return 0 if there have been no wins.</p>

          <p>For example if the input array is as follows:</p>

          <p>
            <img src="../../../../images/completed/7-kyu/Find how many times did a team from a given country win the Champions League/01.png" alt="Winners">
          </p>

          <p>
            <code>countWins(winnerList1, 'Spain')</code> => should return 2<br>
            <code>countWins(winnerList1, 'Portugal')</code> => should return 1<br>
            <code>countWins(winnerList1, 'Sportland')</code> => should return 0
