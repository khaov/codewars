        <section class="instructions">
          <p>This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.</p>
          <p>Point objects have <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> attributes. Circle objects have <code>center</code> which is a <code>Point</code>, and <code>radius</code> which is a number.</p>
          <p>Write a function calculating distance between <code>Circle</code> a and <code>Circle b</code>.</p>
          <p>If they're overlapping or one is completely within the other, just return zero.</p>
          <p>Tests round answers to 6 decimal places, so you don't need to round them yourselves.</p>
